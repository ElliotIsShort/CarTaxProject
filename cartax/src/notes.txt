You are required to design, build, and test a RESTful Web Service through Spring Boot to represent the backend of a road tax management system.
You may make the key implementation decisions for this system, but should support at least the following entities:

⦁	Car registration
⦁	Car owner
⦁	Tax information
⦁	Tax payments

You may need to consider additional entities to support these and will need to define the relationships between these entities. You should additionally create:

DONE	At least two appropriate Data Transfer Objects.
DONE	Appropriate documentation (use automated documentation, e.g., OpenAPI).
DONE	An appropriate security configuration for the system.
DONE	Automated tests to achieve an appropriate (albeit not necessarily complete) level of coverage.
⦁	A Dockerfile to deploy the service.
⦁   Additionally, you should write a report of approximately 1000 words which outlines and describes your design and implementation choices.


There are two possible passwords in order to use authentication. Apologies as I can't remember which one. One of these two .
AUTHENTICATION PASSWORD: "abc123" OR "verysecurepassword"
I believe the "abc123" is the password used for roles while the "verysecurepassword" is used to log into keycloak
